Notes for anyone wanting to build Debian packages of VLC.

 - Default configuration is supposed to be latest unstable.

 - VLC does not link with libdvdcss by default, thus it will not depend
   on the libdvdcss packages. However it will use libdvdread that can
   optionally open libdvdcss if found. To build packages that link directly
   against libdvdcss, remove the --without-dvdcss flag in debian/rules.
